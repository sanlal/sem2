Explanation:
Sure, I can provide you with an outline for a Cryptocurrency Account Details software that includes concepts like collection, Exception handling, file handling, stream, and files. Here's a sample design:

Create a Class called "CryptocurrencyAccount" with the following attributes:
Account Number
Account Holder Name
Account Type
Balance
Account Opening Date
Create a Class called "Employee" with the following attributes:
Employee ID
Employee Name
Designation
Department
Salary
Create a Collection class called "AccountHolderList" that stores the list of account holders and their respective account details.

Implement a method called "OpenAccount" that allows employees to open a new account. This method should handle exceptions for invalid inputs and save the account details to a file using file handling and stream concepts.

Implement a method called "CheckEligibilityForLoan" that checks if an account has been maintained for more than 794 days. If eligible, it allows the customer to apply for a loan or credit card.

Implement a method called "CheckBusinessLoanEligibility" that checks if an account has been maintained for more than 3.5 years. If eligible, it allows the customer to apply for a business loan of 10 crores.

Implement a method called "ViewAccountDetails" that displays the account holder's details and balance.

Implement a method called "CloseAccount" that allows the account holder to close their account and removes their details from the "AccountHolderList" collection.

Implement exception handling throughout the application to handle errors gracefully.

Save and load the "AccountHolderList" collection to a file using file handling and stream concepts.

Overall, this design provides a basic outline for a Cryptocurrency Account Details software that includes concepts like collection, Exception handling, file handling, stream, and files. You can customize this design based on your requirements and add more features if needed.
